## About
Mat Flashcards&Sentences is a prototype educational app creatively based on cram.com and quizlet.com services, as well as Sentence Master Android App, which I used to utilize in my work as an English teacher. My intention was to combine the most valuable features of each of them while adding a few new ideas. <br />

I strongly believe that using flashcards is one of the best ways of memorizing various types of information and a crucial tool when learning languages. Learning the vocabulary usage seems to be an obvious further step, that's why I decided to include a functionality to study complete sentences. <br />

The main goal of developing the project has been to practise building a functional web app, however I really appreciated the notion of creating a potentially useful educative tool.


## Details
The app consists of RoR backend and React frontend working separately, communicating via http requests.

React frontend is under construction ;)
